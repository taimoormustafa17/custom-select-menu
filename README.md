# custom-select-menu
A custom select menu built from scratch allows users to fully style both the select button and the dropdown menu according to their preferences, including the option to display icons alongside dropdown items. Unlike the default select menu, which has many styling limitations, this custom dropdown provides complete design flexibility.
